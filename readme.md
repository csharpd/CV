### Testimonial - Matt Clifford, CEO at Entrepreneur First
_"Chloe is exceptionally effective. I hired Chloe to build out a new business at Entrepreneur First. She succeeded in this in an extremely short period of time and in the process not only built new and deep relationships for the company, but created new institutional knowledge which we now use daily. I was consistently impressed by her mastery of detail, her ability to design new and effective processes and, most of all, her ability to deliver (profitable) results with minimal guidance. I would hire Chloe again in a heartbeat."_
